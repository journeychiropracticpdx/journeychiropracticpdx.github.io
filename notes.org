     From Cassandra:

     on my website, under services, I want to change it to big buttons and only
     listing the following:  Chiropractic, Manual Therapy, Physical Therapy, and
     Yoga Instruction

     I want the chiropractic heading to then have a link that describes it as
     “Gentle adjusting utilizing tools including Activator, Arthrostim, and
     Blocking”

     for Manual Therapy, I want that to have a link to a description “Manual
     therapy utilizing tools including Vibracussor, Cupping, Gua she,
     Therapeutic Ultrasound, Electrical Stimulation (IFC, TENS, Russian Stim),
     and Laser/Low Level Light Therapy).”

     For physical therapy I want to link to Angela’s page.

     And for Yoga, I will have a link to our yoga instructor

    #+begin_quote
    I was thinking of having a picture of a road such as the one attached
    as a slightly transparent background, and then over it say (or open to
    suggestions if you hate this):
    " The Journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"  ... Take
    that step with us.  At Journey Chiropractic we cater each treatment to the
    unique and individual needs, which change from day to day and over time.
    We meet you where you are at, and provide a variety of treatment techniques

     This might be tied in with [[find stock photo of road or make one]].

     #+begin_quote
     Make the general background some type of complimenting color, not
