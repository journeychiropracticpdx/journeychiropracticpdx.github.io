     From Cassandra:

     on my website, under services, I want to change it to big buttons and only
     listing the following:  Chiropractic, Manual Therapy, Physical Therapy, and
     Yoga Instruction

     I want the chiropractic heading to then have a link that describes it as
     “Gentle adjusting utilizing tools including Activator, Arthrostim, and
     Blocking”

     for Manual Therapy, I want that to have a link to a description “Manual
     therapy utilizing tools including Vibracussor, Cupping, Gua she,
     Therapeutic Ultrasound, Electrical Stimulation (IFC, TENS, Russian Stim),
     and Laser/Low Level Light Therapy).”

     For physical therapy I want to link to Angela’s page.

     And for Yoga, I will have a link to our yoga instructor
